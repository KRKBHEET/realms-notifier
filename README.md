// Whitelist of Realms we exclude even from the Unchartered category
// This should be part of the governance/realm registry and curated by the community

// Some fo the realms seem to be autogenerated using names like ckvq40oin3030171ylqhx37z53m.
// If they keep getting added we might want to use some pattern to exclude them

// Other excluded ones are know test DAOs like Test 'Grape Test' for example
//hidden realms
